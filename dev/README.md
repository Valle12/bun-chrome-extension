# Bun Chrome Extension Dev

This package provides functionality to develop a typescript chrome extension.
It hosts all of the logic to transform your typescript chrome extension into a javascript version, that Chrome can understand.
It is not that useful if used alone, so it is embedded into [bun-chrome-extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bun-chrome-extension).
The documentation can be found [here](https://valle12.github.io/bun-chrome-extension/).
