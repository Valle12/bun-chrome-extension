# Usage

You have two options to use the software.
You can either use [Dev](./dev) mode, which spins up a WebSocket Connection to the browser and enables hot reloading, so you can just save your file and directly see your changes reflected in the browser (Not implemented yet).
Or you can use [Build](./build) mode, which transpiles the necessary files once and you need to rebuild when you do some changes.
